# Sequence-Prediction
This repo contains simple LSTM model implementation.This model is made to predict sequence of character ,given the initial characters.
Input is taken in txt formate.In uploaded .py file i have considered sequence length of 40.Epoch is set to 4 but for good result it should be set higher i.e 100.
Model is framed in such a way that if initial characters of a word is given ,it will predict the last one and like that.
